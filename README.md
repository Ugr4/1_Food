## Why you need food
Food is ALWAYS, first and foremost, something you consume that enables your brain and all your internal organs to do their magic so YOU can function and THEY can heal the damage done to your mind and body.

Food can also be:
* Emotional comfort and support.
* A great way to meet people socially, either by helping gather or prepare it for others.
* A way to extend your life.

###But for anyone to get food's most basic benefits, you need the below information

*These daily nutritional values are for one adult human; listed by importance.*

		* Energy..................2000 Calories OR 8700 kJ
		* Sodium..................2,300mg
		* Protein.................50g
		* Dietary fibre...........30g
		* Fat.....................70g
		* Saturated fatty acids...24g
		* Carbohydrate............310g
		* Sugars..................90g

###Concerns

		Q: What am I supposed to do with the above information?
		A: Before we get fancy and start asking questions before we've even started, let's just get you fed first.


		Q: What if I can't/don't eat one (or more) of the above daily; or eat too much?
		A: The closer you can get to the above basic values through controlling your own intake, the greater your mental and physical capacity to both handle problems and improve life. Simple as that.


		Q: Hey, I know we need things like vitamins and minterals! Why aren't they on the list?
		A: Because you need to do the above list every day, whereas 'complete nutritional' information changes greatly depending on every human's biology, environment, situation, and own personal willingness. Not everyone wants their food to come with a political identity, or have to put that much effort or thought into eating, and some people only eat for comfort/pleasure.
